## How we approached the project

  * The approach for this project was that we saw that there are 7 navbar links which are redirecting the main page to the 6 different pages. And then we decide that     we are also 6 people in our group, so we will devide 1 page for each and whenvever if anyone would be facing any problem then we will talk together and we will       sort out the problem. 
  * In the main page we saw that we have to also create some functionalities like sing up, sign in, cart page, payment method and etc. 
    So, we decided that all the members will participate and we will create the things together.

   * The other part was to making the models which popups on the clicking of any button or an element.

 # In backend part
